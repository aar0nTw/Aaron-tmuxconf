Install tmux 1.5 or greater.  This conf has been tested with tmux 1.5

First checkout this repo then symlink it to your home directory.

$ ln -s ~/{LOCATION OF YOUR REPOSITORY}/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

If you want to have the status of your battery
$ ln -s ~/{LOCATION OF YOUR REPOSITORY}/power.sh /usr/local/bin/
